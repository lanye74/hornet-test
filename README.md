# hornet-test

2D physics test. Maybe this will turn into some sort of recreation of the Hornet fight from Hollow Knight?

\* This is inspired heavily by Meth Meth Method's [Super Mario Bros in JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS8HfBXv9ZWWe8zXrViYbIM2Hhylx8DZx).

A few years ago I followed along with his implementation to make my own Mario-like game; however, this project will reference none of that code or that series. Everything will be done through my own research and anything I remember :-) For the sheer joy of it
